# UFO Sightings Visual Analysis using Altair


Below are two interactive Vega-Lite visualizations exported from Altair as JSON files, illustrating temporal and categorical patterns in UFO sightings from 1900–2014.

## UFO Trend Interactive Plot

This line chart visualizes the historical trend of UFO sightings from 1900 to 2014.
The visualization encodes years on the x-axis as ordinal data to show chronological progression, while the y-axis uses quantitative encoding to represent the count of reported sightings.
I chose a simple blue color scheme for the line to maintain visual clarity and direct focus toward understanding the temporal patterns rather than distracting with multiple colors.
For data transformation, I performed significant cleaning including: converting string dates to datetime objects, extracting year and month components, removing records with missing critical fields (year, coordinates, duration), filtering out unrealistic duration values (limiting to under 24 hours to exclude probable data errors), and aggregating individual sightings into annual counts.
The interactive selection feature allows users to drag across specific time intervals, highlighting chosen periods while dimming others.
This interaction enables focused analysis of particular eras, such as examining the rapid growth phase beginning around 1994 or the post-2012 decline period, helping users isolate and compare specific temporal patterns within the broader historical context.


## UFO Shape Scatter Plot

This scatter plot examines the relationship between UFO sighting duration, occurrence year, and object shape across the 1900–2014 timeframe.
The visualization employs multiple encoding types: the x-axis uses ordinal encoding for years to show temporal distribution, the y-axis applies quantitative encoding with logarithmic scale for duration in seconds, and color serves as categorical encoding to distinguish the six most frequently reported UFO shapes.
I implemented a distinct categorical color scheme using Vega-Lite's default palette, selecting six contrasting colors to ensure clear visual separation between shape categories while maintaining accessibility standards.
The logarithmic scale on the y-axis was necessary because duration values spanned several orders of magnitude, from seconds to hours.
For data preparation, I filtered the dataset to include only the top six shapes by frequency to reduce visual clutter, applied logarithmic transformation to duration values to normalize the distribution, and removed geographic and temporal outliers through coordinate validation and year filtering.
The interactive legend selection enables users to click on specific shape categories, dynamically highlighting the corresponding data points while dimming others.
This interactive filtering mechanism allows viewers to isolate patterns for particular shapes, revealing how duration characteristics vary across different UFO types over time, and facilitating comparative analysis of whether certain shapes consistently report longer or shorter sightings throughout different historical periods.
